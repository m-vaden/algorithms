/*
**  Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence
**  of characters in the second string. In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string
**  appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing.


**  Sample Input:
**  isSubseuqence('hello', 'hello world'); //true
**  isSubseuqence('sing', 'sting'); //true
**  isSubseuqence('abc', 'abracadabra'); //true
**  isSubseuqence('abc', 'acb'); //false (order matters)
