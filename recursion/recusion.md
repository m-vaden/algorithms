# Recursion

## Description

Term for a function that calls itself.

### Notes

Don't think about recursion.

1. Create a condition that stops the recursion from continuing when this data set or type reaches its smallest form.
2. Design a function that reduces a data set or type to its smallest form by calling itself.
3. Visualize the interaction of the last 2-3 function calls in reverse order (9 -> 8 -> 7) and make sure it works the way you intend.
