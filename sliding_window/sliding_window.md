# Sliding Window

## For

This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. 
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).
Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

## Notes
 Given a range of values in an array subtract the first and add the next to slowly move the range to the end of the array.
